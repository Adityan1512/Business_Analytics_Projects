# Business Analysis Projects 

Hi, I’m **Adityan**, a London-based **Analyst** with a background in **Business Intelligence, Strategy & Analytics**, and an MSc in **FinTech with Business Analytics** (University of Westminster).

This repository is a portfolio of my university and personal analysis work using tools such as **Python,SQL,Excel & PowerBI**. The focus is always the same: turn messy information into **clear insights**, **simple narratives**, and **practical recommendations**.

  
- **Open to roles:** Analyst / BI / Strategy / Marketing Analytics (available immediately)

## What you’ll see in this repo
Across these notebooks, you’ll find examples of:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory analysis and visual storytelling
- Predictive modelling and evaluation
- Data Visualisation
- Translating outputs into business decisions (what it means + what to do next)



## If you’re interested in my work and think there could be a fit, I’d be happy to chat.
If you’d like, I can quickly walk you through:
- the problem statement and how I structured the analysis
- why I chose specific methods/models
- the business takeaway and what I’d recommend doing next
